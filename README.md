Hey everyone. Here's how you should add your changes to the master branch.

So when you are first added to the project, click clone or download and there will be options to open in desktop or to download the zip.
Click *Open in Desktop*. This is how it is cloned to your github. Choose where to clone it to - this doesn't matter too much, just somewhere you can find it.

When you open the project in Unreal it normally opens a blank map. Click Open Asset and then the map you want to edit - Octagon Map is our only one. For the first time you do this, you will need to connect it to source control - just click source control at the top and then it should just be the standard settings.

When you want to make changes, first go to the GitHub application and create a new branch. Call it something sensible. Then go ahead in Unreal and make all the changes and add whatever you need to add. When you're done, save and then click on source control, then commit to source control. Agin, name the change something sensible. Then go to GitHub and make sure your branch is selected, then go to pull request - it should come up with the name of the changes you just made in Unreal. Submit your pull request.

If successfully submitted, go to GitHub website and look at the request. It will say if there are any conflicts - if not, go ahead and merge. Others can then sync their repositories on GitHub app and see the changes you've made. Yayyyy source control.
